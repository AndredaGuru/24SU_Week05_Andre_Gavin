    <h1> Andre's Intro </h1>
	<p>My name is Andre Gavin. I am a student at Wake Tech in NC, working on my Software Development Associate's degree. It has been quite a journey since graduating high school, but the journey continues. I play  basketball, and 
	enjoy watching anime. Oldest out of 5 siblings, and have 2 dogs, some fish, a bearded dragon and 2 guinea pigs. Welcome to my hectic world. </p>
